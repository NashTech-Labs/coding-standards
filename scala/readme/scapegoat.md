There are two categories of information generated by Scapegoat. i.e. `ERRORS` and `WARNINGS`. 

One should try to minimize the number of `WARNINGS` to zero while `ERRORS` should not exceed more than 0.

Checkout the  [Scapegoat Page](https://github.com/scoverage/sbt-scoverage#minimum-coverage) which details about the various flags which can be set to get reports.

##Configuration:
Checkout [sbt-scapegoat](https://github.com/sksamuel/sbt-scapegoat) which details how to integrate the Scapegoat with sbt.

##Overriding Error/Warning Rules
It is possible to override and turn a particular Error into Warning. The override settings are given at [override](https://github.com/sksamuel/sbt-scapegoat#inspection-warning-level-overrides) section of `sbt-scapegoat` page. 
IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO OVERRIDE RULES until discussed with your Client/Dev lead.
